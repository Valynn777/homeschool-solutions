---

## Core Subjects

### Mathematics
**Recommended Program:** Teaching Textbooks 5
**Time:** 30-40 minutes daily, 4-5 days per week

**Why This Works:**
- Continues familiar program with built-in review
- Independent lessons with video instruction
- Immediate feedback to build confidence
- Self-paced with automatic grading

**Additions:**
- **Math Fact Practice (10 min/day):** Use Xtramath.org (free) or flashcard games to build automaticity with 6-9 multiplication/division tables
- **Real-World Math:** Involve Noah in cooking (fractions/measurement), shopping (money/percentages), or building projects (measurement/geometry)

**Parent Notes:** Let Noah work through lessons independently. Check in afterward to review missed problems together. Aim for mastery, not speed—it's okay to spend 2 days on one lesson if needed.

---

### Language Arts

#### Reading
**Recommended Approach:** Living Books + Read-Alouds
**Time:** 30-60 minutes daily

**Book List Suggestions (Spring 2025):**
- **Independent Reading:** Choose 1-2 books per week from library or home collection. Focus on high-quality literature (historical fiction, adventure, nature).
- **Read-Aloud (Family):** Select one chapter book to enjoy together. Suggestions:
  - *The Hiding Place* by Corrie ten Boom
  - *Carry On, Mr. Bowditch* by Jean Lee Latham
  - *The Bronze Bow* by Elizabeth George Speare (biblical era historical fiction)

**Why This Works:**
- Builds vocabulary and comprehension naturally
- Nurtures love of reading
- Provides rich content and moral lessons
- Easy to implement—just read!

**Parent Notes:** Ask Noah to give oral narrations (2-3 minutes) after each chapter. This builds comprehension, memory, and verbal skills without formal testing.

---

#### Writing & Composition
**Recommended Program:** Institute for Excellence in Writing (IEW) Level A or Simply Classical Writing, Level 1
**Time:** 2-3 sessions per week, 20-30 minutes each

**Why This Works:**
- Structured, step-by-step approach
- Begins with oral composition, transitions to written
- Builds confidence through modeling
- Aligns with Noah's verbal strengths

**Additional Tools:**
- **Copywork (5-10 min, 2-3x/week):** Short passages from Scripture, quality literature, or history readings. Builds handwriting, spelling, and internalization of excellent writing.
- **Dictation (5-10 min, 2x/week):** Teacher reads a short passage, Noah writes it from memory. Builds spelling, punctuation, and focus.

**Parent Notes:** Start with oral narration and outlining. Don't rush into long written assignments. Typing is acceptable for longer pieces if handwriting stamina is an issue.

---

#### Grammar & Mechanics
**Recommended Program:** Simply Grammar Level 1 or First Language Lessons Level 5
**Time:** 15-20 minutes, 3-4x/week

**Why This Works:**
- Gentle, conversational approach
- Short, focused lessons
- Review built into each lesson
- No busywork—just what's needed

**Parent Notes:** Grammar doesn't have to be every day. Consistency matters more than intensity. Focus on understanding, not perfection.

---

### Science
**Recommended Program:** Elemental Science — Biology for the Grammar Stage
**Time:** 2-3 sessions per week, 30-45 minutes each

**Why This Works:**
- Combines reading, hands-on activities, and notebooking
- Cyclical approach with built-in review
- Gentle, Charlotte Mason-inspired methodology
- Age-appropriate and engaging

**Alternative Option:** Apologia Exploring Creation with Botany (if Noah shows strong interest in plants)

**Parent Notes:** Schedule science on specific days (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday) and protect that time. Do the experiments—they're what Noah will remember! Use a simple science notebook to record observations and drawings.

---

### History & Geography
**Recommended Program:** The Mystery of History Volume 2 (Revised) — Early Church & Middle Ages
**Time:** 2-3 sessions per week, 30-40 minutes each

**Why This Works:**
- Engaging narrative style
- Strong biblical/faith integration
- Includes activities, timelines, and mapping
- Covers a wide range of topics (church history, world events, culture)

**Supplemental Tools:**
- **Timeline:** Use a simple wall timeline or notebook timeline to place events visually
- **Map Work:** Trace or color maps from curriculum or print free maps online
- **Read-Alouds:** Add historical fiction or biographies related to time period (Augustine's *Confessions* for older readers, *Beowulf* retellings, etc.)

**Parent Notes:** History doesn't need to be every day—2-3x/week is plenty. Use oral narration as the primary assessment. Let Noah create simple illustrations or act out events to enhance retention.

---

## Faith & Hebrew Studies

### Hebrew Language
**Recommended Program:** Hebrew Quest, Level 1 or Aleph Isn't Tough
**Time:** 10-15 minutes daily, 5 days/week

**Why This Works:**
- Systematic phonics-based approach
- Builds reading fluency with practice
- Appropriate for elementary students
- Short, daily lessons prevent overwhelm

**Parent Notes:** Consistency is key for language learning. Even 10 minutes daily will yield results. Celebrate progress, not perfection.

---

### Torah & Scripture Study
**Recommended Approach:** Family-Led Bible Study + Scripture Memory
**Time:** 15-20 minutes daily (integrated into morning time or family devotions)

**Suggestions:**
- **Weekly Torah Portion:** Discuss the parasha together as a family. Let Noah narrate or illustrate key points.
- **Scripture Memory:** Choose one verse or short passage per month to memorize together (e.g., Psalm 119 selections, Proverbs, key teachings of Y'eshua).
- **Character Study:** Pick one biblical character per month (Abraham, Joseph, David, Daniel, Paul, etc.) and read through their story. Discuss character qualities, faith, and lessons learned.

**Optional Resource:** *God's Story for Me* Bible or *The Action Bible* for visual learners

**Parent Notes:** Keep it conversational and age-appropriate. The goal is to cultivate love for Scripture and understanding of Yehovah's character, not to check boxes.
