## Walking in Yehovah's Ways

*"Hear, O Israel: Yehovah our God, Yehovah is one. You shall love Yehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise."*
**— Deuteronomy 6:4-7**

David and Rachel, the work you are doing in your home is not merely academic—it is a sacred calling. You have chosen to walk the ancient paths, to honor Yehovah's instructions, and to raise Noah in the fear and admonition of the Lord. This is no small thing. You are fulfilling the beautiful mandate given to Israel: to teach your son diligently, not just in formal lessons, but in the rhythm of daily life.

As you sit together over math problems and science experiments, as you walk through the pages of history and explore the wonders of creation, you are weaving the truth of Yehovah's Word into Noah's heart. When you pause to honor Shabbat, when you celebrate the appointed feasts, when you speak of Y'eshua's sacrifice and redemption—you are building an inheritance of faith that will endure far beyond any test score or grade level.

## Y'eshua, Our Perfect Teacher

Y'eshua Himself is our model. He learned Torah as a child, growing "in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man" (Luke 2:52). He was taught by faithful parents who brought Him to the Temple, who instructed Him in the ways of Yehovah. And when the time came, He walked perfectly in obedience to the Father, fulfilling every jot and tittle of the Law.

In the same way, you are preparing Noah not just for college or career, but to walk as a disciple of Y'eshua—one who loves Yehovah's Torah, who seeks wisdom, and who uses his mind and talents to glorify the King. Every hour spent in diligent study, every moment of patience when the work is hard, every breakthrough and every struggle—all of it is shaping Noah into the man Yehovah has called him to be.

## Press On with Confidence

There will be days when the path feels unclear, when Noah struggles and you wonder if you're doing enough. In those moments, remember that Yehovah is faithful. He has entrusted Noah to you, and He will equip you with everything you need.

*"Trust in Yehovah with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths."*
**— Proverbs 3:5-6**

You do not walk this road alone. The same Spirit that empowered the disciples dwells in you. The same Word that guided Israel through the wilderness is your lamp and light. And the same Messiah who welcomed the children and said, "Let them come to Me," delights in Noah's growth and rejoices over your faithfulness.

## A Blessing Over Your Home

May Yehovah bless you and keep you as you teach Noah. May His face shine upon your homeschool and be gracious to you. May He lift up His countenance upon your family and give you shalom—peace, completeness, and joy in the journey.

May Noah grow in wisdom and understanding, rooted in the truth of Scripture and the love of Y'eshua. May he learn to seek Yehovah with all his heart, to love His commandments, and to walk in righteousness all the days of his life.

And may you, dear parents, be strengthened and encouraged, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. You are training up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.

*"The fear of Yehovah is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction."*
**— Proverbs 1:7**

Press on, faithful ones. You are doing a beautiful work.
