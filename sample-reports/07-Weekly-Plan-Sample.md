## Parent Tips for Implementation

### Keep It Flexible
This schedule is a **guide**, not a rigid rule. If Noah needs more time on math, let history wait. If science runs long because the experiment is fascinating, that's a win! Flexibility honors real learning.

### Use Timers
Set a timer for each subject block to help Noah stay on track and know what to expect. Timers also help him build stamina and focus.

### Movement Breaks
Don't skip breaks! Noah needs to move. A quick 10-minute outdoor break resets his brain and makes the next subject more productive.

### Morning Time
Consider starting the day with a 15-20 minute "morning basket" time where you read aloud, sing, pray, and review memory work together. This sets a peaceful, positive tone.

### Batch Similar Tasks
Group subjects that require Mom's direct involvement (writing, grammar, read-aloud) and alternate with independent work (math, reading, Hebrew practice).

### End on a High Note
Try to finish each day with something enjoyable—a good chapter from read-aloud, a fun experiment, or outdoor time. This leaves Noah (and you!) looking forward to tomorrow.

## Adjustments for Hard Days

**If Noah is struggling with focus:**
- Shorten work blocks to 10-15 minutes
- Do every-other problem in math
- Narrate orally instead of writing
- Take extra movement breaks

**If Mom is overwhelmed:**
- Skip one content subject (science or history)
- Use audiobooks for read-alouds
- Do only core subjects (math, reading, writing)
- Lower expectations and choose relationship over curriculum

**If Friday feels too busy:**
- Move Shabbat prep to Thursday afternoon
- Skip formal school on Friday entirely and do family read-aloud only

---

## Looking Ahead

This weekly rhythm should feel **sustainable and enjoyable**. If it doesn't, adjust! The goal is steady, incremental progress—not perfection.
