## 5. Faith-Based Encouragement

*Full document: See [05-Faith-Based-Encouragement.md](05-Faith-Based-Encouragement.md)*

### A Word from Scripture

*"Hear, O Israel: Yehovah our God, Yehovah is one. You shall love Yehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children..."* — Deuteronomy 6:4-7

David and Rachel, the work you are doing is not merely academic—it is a sacred calling. You are fulfilling the beautiful mandate given to Israel: to teach your son diligently, not just in formal lessons, but in the rhythm of daily life.

As you sit together over math and science, as you walk through history and explore creation, you are weaving the truth of Yehovah's Word into Noah's heart. Every hour spent in diligent study, every breakthrough and struggle—all of it is shaping Noah into the man Yehovah has called him to be.

### Y'eshua, Our Perfect Teacher

Y'eshua Himself grew "in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man" (Luke 2:52). In the same way, you are preparing Noah not just for college or career, but to walk as a disciple of Y'eshua—one who loves Yehovah's Torah, seeks wisdom, and uses his talents to glorify the King.

### Press On with Confidence

*"Trust in Yehovah with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths."* — Proverbs 3:5-6

May Yehovah bless you and keep you as you teach Noah. May His face shine upon your homeschool and be gracious to you. May you be strengthened, knowing that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.
