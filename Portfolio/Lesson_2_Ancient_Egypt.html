                <p><strong>The Gift of the Nile</strong></p>
                <p>Ancient Egypt was one of the world's greatest civilizations, flourishing from around 2500 BC to 30 BC—beginning several centuries after the Tower of Babel and Noah's Flood (Genesis 10-11). The Egyptians were descendants of Ham through his son Mizraim (Genesis 10:6), whose name means "Egypt" in Hebrew.</p>
                <p>Despite rejecting the one true God and worshipping false gods like Ra, Osiris, and Isis, the Egyptians demonstrated the intelligence and capabilities God gave to all mankind. The Nile River, part of God's created order, made life possible in the desert by providing water, fertile soil, and transportation. Egyptian farmers grew crops like wheat and barley, allowing their civilization to develop remarkable achievements—though their hearts remained far from their Creator.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Great Pyramids were built as tombs for pharaohs using millions of stone blocks, showing the remarkable abilities God gave to all people—even those who rejected Him.</li>
            <li>Egyptians developed hieroglyphics, one of the earliest writing systems. Though they used this to worship false gods, it demonstrates how God created humans with the capacity for language and communication.</li>
            <li>They created a 365-day calendar by observing God's design of the sun, moon, and stars (Genesis 1:14), even though they worshipped these creations instead of the Creator.</li>
            <li>Egyptian doctors were skilled in medicine, surgery, and plant remedies, using knowledge of God's creation—though they didn't acknowledge Him as the source of all healing.</li>
            <li>God used Egypt in His redemptive plan: Joseph was sold into Egypt and later saved his family (Genesis 37-50), the Israelites lived there for 400 years, and God demonstrated His power through Moses and the Exodus (Exodus 1-14), showing He is the one true God above all of Egypt's false gods.</li>
