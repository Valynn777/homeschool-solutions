                    <h3>Personal Information You Provide</h3>
                    <p>We only collect information that you voluntarily provide to us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contact Form:</strong> When you submit our contact form, we collect your name, email address, subject, and message. This information is processed through Formspree and sent to our email.</li>
                        <li><strong>Appointment Scheduling:</strong> When you schedule an appointment through Calendly, that service collects your scheduling information according to their own privacy policy. We receive appointment details necessary to provide services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent Support Sessions:</strong> During sessions, you may share details about your homeschool situation, children's ages/grades, curriculum preferences, educational goals, and challenges. This information is used solely to provide support services.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> All payment processing is handled directly by third-party processors (Stripe, PayPal, Square). We do not collect, store, or have access to your complete payment card details.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                    <p>Unlike many websites, we do NOT:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Google Analytics or other tracking services</li>

                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All of our free tools (lesson generator, worksheet generator, schedule builder, etc.) operate entirely within your browser using client-side JavaScript. This means:</p>

                        <li>We have zero access to your tool data</li>
                        <li>Data is stored only in your browser's local storage (which you control and can clear at any time)</li>
                        <li>Your work is completely private to you</li>
